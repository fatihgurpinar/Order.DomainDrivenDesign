- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) (optional, if using a database)

## Project Structure

- `Order.Domain`: Contains the domain models, events, and seed work.
- `Order.Application`: Contains application services, domain event handlers, and repositories interfaces.
- `Order.Infrastructure`: Contains the implementation of repositories and database context.
- `Order.WebApi`: Contains the ASP.NET Core Web API project.

Here is a detailed instruction for setting up and running the project based on .NET 8:

2. Build the Solution
Open the solution file Order.DomainDrivenDesign.sln in Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and build the solution to restore the NuGet packages and compile the projects.

Alternatively, you can use the .NET CLI:

dotnet build

3. Update Database (Optional)
If you are using a database, update the connection string in appsettings.json and run the following command to apply migrations:

dotnet ef database update --project Order.Infrastructure

4. Run the Application
You can run the application using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code by setting Order.WebApi as the startup project and pressing F5.

Alternatively, you can use the .NET CLI:

dotnet run --project Order.WebApi

The application will start, and you can access it at https://localhost:5001 or http://localhost:5000.
